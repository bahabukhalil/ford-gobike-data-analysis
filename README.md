# Ford GoBike Data Analysis Project

This repository contains a full exploratory and explanatory data analysis of the Ford GoBike bike-sharing dataset (February 2019) using Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn).

## 📂 Project Structure

- `Part_I_exploration_template.ipynb` — Notebook for exploratory analysis.
- `Part_II_slide_deck_template.ipynb` — Notebook for explanatory presentation.
- `data/` — Contains the dataset `201902-fordgobike-tripdata.csv`.
